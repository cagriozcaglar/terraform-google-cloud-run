  title: Secure Cloud Run (v2) Service
  description:
    tagline: A module for deploying secure and scalable services on Cloud Run (v2).
    detailed: |
      This Terraform module provides a comprehensive and secure way to deploy services
      to Google Cloud Run (v2). It is designed with enterprise best practices in mind,
      including least-privilege service accounts, secure secret management, fine-grained
      ingress/egress control, and detailed health checks. The module supports both
      simple public APIs and complex internal microservices connected to a VPC.
